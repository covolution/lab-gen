# DVLA Emerging Tech Lab Generative AI Experiments

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- `pipx install uv`
- `uv sync`

### Quick Start

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dvla/lab-gen)

[![Open in VS Code Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/dvla/lab-gen)

To run the project use this set of commands:

Setup the `.env` file:
```bash
cp example.env .env
echo 'LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_URI=https://my-store.documents.azure.com:443/'  >> .env
echo 'LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_KEY=0177PWaDjWhceFttEK4Q=='  >> .env
```

Setup your models config:

 `cp -r example_secrets secrets`.

 or if using codespaces with Github Models:

 `cp -r example_github_secrets secrets`

 Edit the `AZURE_MODELS` file in `./secrets`.

Run the application:
```bash
uv run python -m lab_gen
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

A simple test request is:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/conversations' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-business-user: king.kong' \
  -H 'Authorization: 1234' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "content": "What is the DVLA?"
}'
```

## Project structure

```bash
$ tree "lab_gen"
lab_gen
├── conftest.py  # Fixtures for all tests.
├── __main__.py  # Startup script. Starts uvicorn.
├── services  # Package for different external services such as openai or cosmosdb etc.
├── settings.py  # Main configuration settings for project.
├── static  # Static content.
├── tests  # Tests for project.
└── web  # Package contains web server. Handlers, startup config.
    ├── api  # Package with all handlers.
    │   └── router.py  # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifetime.py  # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "LAB_GEN_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "lab_gen/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "LAB_GEN_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `lab_gen.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
LAB_GEN_RELOAD="True"
LAB_GEN_PORT="8000"
LAB_GEN_ENVIRONMENT="myname"
LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_URI=https://my-store.documents.azure.com:443/
LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_KEY=0177PWaDjWhceFttEK4Q==
LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_TTL=172800
AZURE_APP_API_KEY=1234
AZURE_MODELS=[{"provider": "AZURE","variant": "GENERAL","identifier": "gpt-35-1106","description": "OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo powered","location":"UK"},{"provider": "AZURE","variant": "ADVANCED","identifier": "gpt-4-1106","description": "OpenAI GPT-4","location":"UK"}]
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING="InstrumentationKey=99x99999-9xxx-9999-x9x9-9999999x999x;IngestionEndpoint=https://example.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/;LiveEndpoint=https://example.livediagnostics.monitor.azure.com/"
LOGURU_LEVEL="INFO"
TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR=tiktoken_cache
```

### Model config
The model configuration is a json list and can be specified in any of the following ways:
1. If an `APPCONFIGURATION_CONNECTION_STRING` is specifed then any variables starting with `AZURE` are looked up in Azure App Config.
    e.g. `AZURE_MODELS`.
2. `AZURE_MODELS` can be specified as an enviroment variable on a single line (see example above).
3. A `secrets` folder can be used to set values.  For example, rename the `example_secrets` folder to just `secrets` and the `AZURE_MODELS` file will be used for the model configuration.

### Github CodeSpaces/Models
The project will run out of the box in Codespaces with Github Models by following the quick start instructions. Model availability will depend on your Github subscription and certain premium models may not be available.

Further detail on model availabilty and rate limits can be found in the [Github Models documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/use-github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits).

To use Github models in other environments, you will need to [create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `models:read` permission](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) in your GitHub account. You can then set this token in your `.env` file as follows:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token_here"
```

### AWS Guardrails

AWS Guardrails can be configured on the Bedrock models by adding the 'guardrailId' and 'guardrailversion' to the config.

An example of a Bedrock config with Guardrails configured:
```bash
["provider": "BEDROCK",
"variant": "ADVANCED",
"family": "CLAUDE",
"identifier": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet",
"description": "Claude 3 Sonnet",
"location": "Paris",
"config":{"AWS_REGION": "eu-west-3",
          "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "xxxxx",
          "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "xxxxx",
          "guardrailIdentifier": "ejgbdBFg5TD",
          "guardrailVersion": "DRAFT"}]
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

You can read more about pre-commit here: https://pre-commit.com/

## Running tests

For running tests on your local machine.


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
uv run pytest -vv
```

## Langfuse

Langfuse tracks traces of LLM calls. Traces can be view at [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com). You need to add the following to ```.env```.

```bash
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="secret-key" # available from langfuse cloud Settings
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="public-key" # available from langfuse cloud Settings
LANGFUSE_HOST="langfuse host url" # available from langfuse cloud Settings
```
