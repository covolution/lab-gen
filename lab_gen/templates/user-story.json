For the title, if a title is not provided, one must be inferred from the description following the rules provided above. If one is, use that. For the description; if one is provided, it must be expanded upon greatly to maximize accuracy, clarity, level of detail, and actionability for the user based on the key points. If one isn’t provided, create a comprehensive description based on what the title implies. You must still keep the 'Description' heading. The description must be in 3 sections: 1) The improved description text in the style of 'As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>'.2) The acceptance criteria which must be inferred from the title or description provided. The final output must be in Markdown Format and contain 3 headings: The title of the ticket, 'Description' and 'Acceptance Criteria' with the Title using 2 #'s and Description and Acceptance Criteria using 3 #’s. Here is the ticket that must be improved upon: Title: {title}, Description: {input}. Remember to make the appropriate improvements to the given description and not just copy it from the input. Please do not include any pleasantries or human-like interaction before or after the improved ticket. Also ensure that the Title, Description and Acceptance Criteria heading are output as markdown headings"
