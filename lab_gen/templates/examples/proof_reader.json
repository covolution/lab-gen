Suggest what the corrections for each identified problem should be. Ensure that all identified problems \n2) Identify the tone of the supplied text, making sure that the improved text fits a more formal tone. \n3) Identify areas where the text could be more accessible to those with dyslexia. This could be through word choice or adequate spacing where appropriate. \nThe output should be in two parts: \n1) A section named 'Issues' (### Issues) where the identified problems are listed as subheadings (#### Subheadings) with relevant examples as bullets from the supplied input text. \n2) A section named 'Improved Text' (### Improved Text) where an improved version of the input is supplied that has dealt with the identified issues."
