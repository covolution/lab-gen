2024-05-12T10:00:45Z,Agent,,"you'll need to send us your old license along with the D1 application form for car/motorcycle licenses..."
2024-05-12T10:00:48Z,Customer,,"D1 form, got it."
2024-05-12T10:00:50Z,Agent,,"or D2 for lorry/bus licenses."
2024-05-12T10:00:52Z,Customer,,"Okay."
2024-05-12T10:00:55Z,Agent,,"You can get those forms at most Post Offices."
2024-05-12T10:00:57Z,Customer,,"Right."
2024-05-12T10:01:00Z,Customer,,"What else do I need to send?"
2024-05-12T10:01:05Z,Agent,,"Along with the completed D1 form"
2024-05-12T10:01:07Z,Customer,,"Yes?"
2024-05-12T10:01:10Z,Agent,,"and your old license,"
2024-05-12T10:01:12Z,Customer,,"Okay."
2024-05-12T10:01:15Z,Agent,,"you'll need to include original documents confirming your new name, like a marriage certificate."
2024-05-12T10:01:18Z,Customer,,"Got it."
2024-05-12T10:01:22Z,Customer,,"Umm, hang on..."
2024-05-12T10:01:25Z,Customer,,"I seem to have misplaced my old license. I can't find it anywhere."
2024-05-12T10:01:28Z,Agent,,"Oh no!"
2024-05-12T10:01:32Z,Customer,,"Yeah, it's gone."
2024-05-12T10:01:35Z,Agent,,"No worries, you can still apply if your old license is lost or stolen."
2024-05-12T10:01:38Z,Customer,,"Okay, what do I need to do then?"
2024-05-12T10:01:42Z,Agent,,"When you fill out the D1 form,"
2024-05-12T10:01:45Z,Agent,,"just explain that it's been misplaced and include a £20 fee payable to DVLA."
2024-05-12T10:01:48Z,Customer,,"Wait, what?"
2024-05-12T10:02:00Z,Customer,,"I have to pay £20 just because I lost my license? That's ridiculous!"
2024-05-12T10:02:03Z,Agent,,"I understand your frustration, but -"
2024-05-12T10:02:05Z,Customer,,"No, that's crazy!"
2024-05-12T10:02:08Z,Agent,,"Please let me explain."
2024-05-12T10:02:12Z,Customer,,"Ugh, fine, go on."
2024-05-12T10:02:15Z,Agent,,"Yes there is a £20 fee if you cannot send in your old license when applying for a new one with a name change."
2024-05-12T10:02:18Z,Customer,,"Unbelievable."
2024-05-12T10:02:22Z,Agent,,"I apologize, but -"
2024-05-12T10:02:25Z,Customer,,"That's absurd. I'm already having to go through the hassle of changing my name on everything,"
2024-05-12T10:02:30Z,Customer,,"and now you're charging me for losing a little plastic card?"
2024-05-12T10:02:33Z,Agent,,"Sir, please."
2024-05-12T10:02:38Z,Customer,,"What? What else is there?"
2024-05-12T10:02:40Z,Agent,,"The £20 fee helps cover the administrative costs of issuing a new license without the old one being returned."
2024-05-12T10:02:45Z,Agent,,"It's not just arbitrary, those are the rules set by DVLA."
2024-05-12T10:02:48Z,Customer,,"I see..."
2024-05-12T10:02:52Z,Agent,,"I understand it's frustrating, but I have to follow their policies."
2024-05-12T10:02:55Z,Customer,,"Ugh, fine. So to summarize - I need to fill out the D1 form,"
2024-05-12T10:02:58Z,Agent,,"Yes, that's right."
2024-05-12T10:03:00Z,Customer,,"include documentation proving my new name like a marriage certificate, and send a £20 cheque since I lost my old license. Is that correct?"
2024-05-12T10:03:07Z,Customer,,"Am I understanding it properly?"
2024-05-12T10:03:10Z,Agent,,"Yes, that's correct. Fill out the D1 form,"
2024-05-12T10:03:13Z,Customer,,"Okay."
2024-05-12T10:03:15Z,Agent,,"include your original marriage certificate or other name change documents, and a £20 cheque or postal order payable to DVLA since you cannot send in your old license."
2024-05-12T10:03:22Z,Customer,,"Alright, I'll do that then."
2024-05-12T10:03:25Z,Customer,,"Thanks for clarifying, even if I don't agree with the fee."
2024-05-12T10:03:28Z,Agent,,"You're welcome."
2024-05-12T10:03:32Z,Agent,,"I understand your frustration with the fee, but I have to follow DVLA's policies."
2024-05-12T10:03:35Z,Agent,,"Let me know if you need any other assistance."
2024-05-12T10:03:40Z,Customer,,"No, that's all."
2024-05-12T10:03:45Z,Customer,,"Thanks for your help."
2024-05-12T10:03:50Z,Agent,,"Thank you for calling."
2024-05-12T10:03:55Z,Agent,,"Have a good day."
