2024-04-12T10:00:00.0000000Z,Agent,,"How can I assist you today?"
2024-04-12T10:00:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"Yeah, hi."
2024-04-12T10:00:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"I received a letter saying I owe a fine for not declaring my car off the road,"
2024-04-12T10:00:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"but I'm pretty sure I did that already."
2024-04-12T10:00:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"I understand your concern."
2024-04-12T10:00:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"Could you provide me with your vehicle's registration number, so I can look into this further?"
2024-04-12T10:00:25.0000000Z,Caller,,JK51 VMZ
2024-04-12T10:00:30.0000000Z,Agent,,"Okay, let me check the records for that registration number."
2024-04-12T10:01:00.0000000Z,Agent,,"I apologize, but our records indicate that you have not declared a Statutory Off Road Notification, or SORN, for this vehicle."
2024-04-12T10:01:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"That can't be right."
2024-04-12T10:01:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"I distinctly remember doing that online last year when I took it off the road for repairs."
2024-04-12T10:01:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"I understand your frustration, but without an active SORN, you are liable for the fine."
2024-04-12T10:01:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"Could you provide me with the details of when and how you believe you submitted the SORN?"
2024-04-12T10:01:30.0000000Z,Caller,,"I don't have the exact date, but it was sometime in June or July of last year."
2024-04-12T10:01:30.0000000Z,Caller,,"I did it through the website, like I've done before."
2024-04-12T10:01:40.0000000Z,Agent,,"Hmm, I'm not seeing any record of a SORN submission for your vehicle in our system during that timeframe."
2024-04-12T10:01:40.0000000Z,Agent,,"Are you absolutely certain you completed the process correctly?"
2024-04-12T10:01:50.0000000Z,Caller,,"Yes, I'm positive!"
2024-04-12T10:01:50.0000000Z,Caller,,"This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to pay a fine because of your system's mistake."
2024-04-12T10:02:00.0000000Z,Agent,,"Sir, I understand your frustration, but without proof of a successfully submitted SORN, I cannot waive the fine."
2024-04-12T10:02:00.0000000Z,Agent,,"Is there any documentation you have that shows you completed the process?"
2024-04-12T10:02:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"No, I don't have any documentation."
2024-04-12T10:02:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"I just followed the online steps like normal."
2024-04-12T10:02:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"In that case, I'm afraid there is little I can do. The fine stands unless you can provide evidence that a SORN was properly submitted."
2024-04-12T10:02:30.0000000Z,Caller,,"This is unbelievable."
2024-04-12T10:02:30.0000000Z,Caller,,"You're basically calling me a liar and accusing me of not doing something I clearly did."
2024-04-12T10:02:40.0000000Z,Agent,,"I apologize if I've caused any offense, that is not my intention at all."
2024-04-12T10:02:40.0000000Z,Agent,,"I'm simply going by the information in our system, which does not show an active SORN for your vehicle."
2024-04-12T10:02:50.0000000Z,Caller,,"Well your system is wrong then, isn't it?"
2024-04-12T10:02:50.0000000Z,Caller,,"I demand that this fine be waived and my record updated to show the SORN."
2024-04-12T10:03:00.0000000Z,Agent,,"Unfortunately, without documented proof, I do not have the authority to waive the fine or update records."
2024-04-12T10:03:00.0000000Z,Agent,,"However, I can escalate this issue to a supervisor for further review if you'd like."
2024-04-12T10:03:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"Yes, please do that."
2024-04-12T10:03:10.0000000Z,Caller,,"This is absolutely ridiculous customer service."
2024-04-12T10:03:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"Very well, let me transfer you to a supervisor who can look into this further."
2024-04-12T10:03:20.0000000Z,Agent,,"One moment please."
2024-04-12T10:03:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"Hello, this is Susan, a DVLA supervisor."
2024-04-12T10:03:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I understand there is an issue regarding a SORN declaration and fine."
2024-04-12T10:03:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"How can I assist you today?"
2024-04-12T10:03:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"Yes, hello."
2024-04-12T10:03:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"I've been trying to explain to your agent that I properly declared my vehicle off the road last year,"
2024-04-12T10:03:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"but your records seem to be incorrect..."
2024-04-12T10:04:20.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I see, let me pull up the details here..."
2024-04-12T10:04:20.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"Mr. Johnson, is that correct?"
2024-04-12T10:04:25.0000000Z,Caller,,"No, it's Taylor. David Taylor."
2024-04-12T10:04:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"My apologies, Mr. Taylor."
2024-04-12T10:04:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I have the details regarding the SORN issue and outstanding fine for your vehicle registration JK51 VMZ."
2024-04-12T10:04:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"Yes, that's the one."
2024-04-12T10:04:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"As I was trying to explain, I definitely submitted that SORN notice when I took the car off the road last summer."
2024-04-12T10:04:50.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I understand your position, Mr. Taylor."
2024-04-12T10:04:50.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"While I cannot find record of a successfully processed SORN declaration,"
2024-04-12T10:04:50.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I can see where there may have been an issue with the online submission based on the notes here."
2024-04-12T10:05:00.0000000Z,Caller,,"Finally, someone who actually listens!"
2024-04-12T10:05:00.0000000Z,Caller,,"So what needs to happen to get this sorted out?"
2024-04-12T10:05:10.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"For situations like this, I'd recommend submitting a formal appeal along with any documentation you may have,"
2024-04-12T10:05:10.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"such as confirmation screenshots from the website when you attempted the SORN last year."
2024-04-12T10:05:20.0000000Z,Caller,,"I don't have any documentation like that."
2024-04-12T10:05:20.0000000Z,Caller,,"As I said, I just followed the normal online process."
2024-04-12T10:05:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I understand, Mr. Taylor."
2024-04-12T10:05:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"In that case, I would still recommend you submit a formal appeal explaining the situation in detail."
2024-04-12T10:05:30.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"Our review team can then investigate further and make a fair determination on the standing of the fine."
2024-04-12T10:05:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"Okay, fine. I'll submit an appeal,"
2024-04-12T10:05:40.0000000Z,Caller,,"but this whole situation has been extremely frustrating."
2024-04-12T10:05:50.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"You're absolutely right, this has clearly caused you a significant inconvenience, and I apologize for that."
2024-04-12T10:05:50.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"I assure you, your appeal will be given a thorough review."
2024-04-12T10:05:50.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"Let me provide you the details for submitting that."
2024-04-12T10:06:20.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"...And Mr. Taylor, I've also made a note on your account regarding this issue, so it will be referenced during the appeal review process."
2024-04-12T10:06:30.0000000Z,Caller,,"Alright, thank you for actually taking the time to listen and escalate this properly."
2024-04-12T10:06:40.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"You're very welcome, Mr. Taylor. We strive to provide exceptional service,"
2024-04-12T10:06:40.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"and I'm sorry we initially fell short in resolving this for you."
2024-04-12T10:06:40.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"Please let me know if any other issues arise during the appeal process."
2024-04-12T10:06:50.0000000Z,Caller,,"I will. Thanks again."
2024-04-12T10:06:55.0000000Z,Supervisor,,"You're welcome. Have a great rest of your day."
